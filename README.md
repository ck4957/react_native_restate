## Get Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

   - [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
   - [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the `app` directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/).

## Get a Fresh Project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the `app-example` directory and create a blank `app` directory where you can start developing.
